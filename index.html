    <h1>Hi Maniskuu!</h1> 
    <p>Happy special birthday! Today is the day to celebrate your extraordinary existence. In the journey of life, I am grateful to have you by my side.
<br><br>
I want to say that you are the most wonderful person I have ever known. You are the sweetest, funniest, and coolest person, as well as the most adorable, friendly, and kind. Thank you for always being patient, understanding, and always faithfully listening to my babble. You always make me feel comfortable, safe, and happy.  Thank you for being a good lover and always reliable! 
<br><br>
I hope that with your increasing age, you will become more mature, wise, responsible, and certainly healthy. May this year and the following year be a year full of happiness, success, and love.   May all your dreams and hopes come true. May your every day be filled with joy and great achievements. I pray to God that good things will always be with you. You deserve the best, because you are the best.
<br><br>
I'm sorry I haven't been able to be a good boyfriend for you, thank you also for sticking with me who is selfish. Hopefully we last a long time. Don't forget that I'm always here, whenever you need me.
<br><br>
Once again, happy birthday sweety. I love you, and I really love you! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚</p>
